GOPack Documentation: File formats for circle packing data.

NOTES:
* All data files are plain ASCII.
* See samples in the "data/" subdirectory


INPUTS: Typically, the inputs are combinatorial only. Essential is
data for the "complex" K, which encodes the number and neighbor
relationships of the circles in the desired circle packing P. All
other information can be provided by the user once K has been loaded
or will be set with default procedures in GOPack. For example, one may
designate an interior "alpha" vertex and a second "gamma" vertex to be
used in normalizations, and for a "polygonal" circle packing, one may
specify the boundary vertices which are to act as "corners" and, 
optionally, a list of angle sums for these corners. 

OUTPUTS: Typically, an output file will give an encoding of K, lists
of radii and x-y coordinates of centers for P, an indication of the 
geometry of the radii/centers ("euclidean", "hyperbolic", or "spherical"), 
the alpha and gamma vertices, a list of corner vertices for polygonal
packings, and, if necessary, a map giving the original vertex indexing.

NOTE: GOPack has default procedures for all input and output data other
than the complex K itself.

===============================

The PREFERRED FORMAT for both input and output is that designed for
the software package CirclePack, namely, the *.p file format given
below. Here the combinatorics of K are specified by giving, for each
vertex, the counterclockwise list of neighboring vertices 

Alternately, GOPack can create K based on a listing of its triangles;
the input file should list triples ofvertices, v1 v2 v3, defining faces,
one face per line. If necessary, GOpack will reindex vertices so they
run contiguously from 1; original indices can be recovered from the 
"VERTEX_MAP:" section of the output *.p file. The triangles need not 
be consistently oriented, but if the triangulation cannot be orientabled
then an error message will result.

For other input formats, it is recommended that the user write a routine
to reindex, if necessary, and put the data in the *.p format.

GOPack computations are carried out in euclidean geometry, and the
user can optionally save a circle packing in its euclidean form
irrespective of its intrinsic geometry.
